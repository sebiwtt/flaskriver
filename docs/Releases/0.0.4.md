## Interface
The package was restructured so that there is a base [`Interface`](../API/Interface.md) class from which the [`RegressionInterface`](../API/RegressionInterface.md) and [`ClassificationInterface`](../API/ClassificationInterface.md) class inherit.

## RegressionInterface
There is now a dedicated Interface for Regression models.

## ClassificationInterface
There is now a dedicated Interface for Classification models.

## Tests
Tests were written to check all the functionality of the endpoints for both Classification and Regression Interfaces.
