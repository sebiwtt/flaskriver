# Installation

To use Flaskriver it is recommended to use Python 3.8 or higher. You can easily install the package using `pip`:

```sh
pip3 install flaskriver
```


Of course, you can also download the code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sebiwtt/flaskriver) or directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flaskriver/) and build it yourself.
